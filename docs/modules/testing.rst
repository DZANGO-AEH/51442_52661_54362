Testing Methods and Approaches
================================================

In this project, comprehensive testing has been implemented to ensure the functionality, performance, and reliability of the system. The testing strategies include unit testing, integration testing, and manual testing. Below is an overview of the testing methods and approaches used:

Unit Testing
------------------------------------------------

Unit tests were used to validate the functionality of individual components of the system. These tests were designed to ensure that each function, method, and class performs as expected in isolation from the rest of the system.

- **Scope**: Unit tests cover various parts of the application, including user management, content management, subscription management, financial management, and messaging.
- **Tools**: Django's built-in test framework and `pytest` are used for writing and executing unit tests.
- **Execution**: Unit tests are executed using the command `python manage.py test` or with `pytest` for more advanced testing scenarios. There were also custom test management commands to run specific test cases.

Integration Testing
------------------------------------------------

Integration tests are used to verify that different components of the system work together as expected. These tests are essential for detecting issues that may arise when individual modules interact with each other.

- **Scope**: Integration tests focus on critical workflows, such as user registration and login, post creation and deletion, subscription processes, and financial transactions.
- **Tools**: Django's test framework, along with `pytest`.
- **Execution**: Integration tests were executed similarly to unit tests using Django's test management commands.

Manual Testing
------------------------------------------------

Manual testing was performed to validate the user interface and overall user experience. This involves navigating through the application, performing various actions, and verifying that the application behaves as expected.

- **Scope**: Manual testing included verifying the correctness of web pages, form submissions, user interactions, and the overall look and feel of the application.
- **Tools**: Manual testing was performed using web browsers, with test scenarios documented in a testing checklist.

Test Documentation
------------------------------------------------

For detailed information about the unit tests, including the specific tests implemented, test cases, and their expected outcomes, please refer to the `tests.rst`_.

Summary
------------------------------------------------

The testing strategy employed in this project ensures that the application is robust, reliable, and performs as expected. By combining unit testing, integration testing, and manual testing, we have aimed to cover all critical aspects of the system and ensure a high level of quality and user satisfaction.
